# ITale (In Progress)

**ITale** is a full-stack blog application built using the MERN stack. It consolidates and extends work completed during the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en) course by the University of Helsinki, with additional features such as JWT-based authentication, global state management using Redux, and API interaction via React Query.

This project serves as a capstone to reinforce and showcase practical use of full-stack development concepts, including backend services, token-based authentication, and dynamic frontend interactions.
